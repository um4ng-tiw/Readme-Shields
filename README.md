# Readme-Shields

### üßê About

A readme best describes the content and aim of your repository and the project, however most of your time should be spent on building amazing things rather than a readme. This repo provides the Github users with various shields to be used in their readme file to make it aesthetically pleasing. The repo also consists of a sample readme inspired by https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template with a few changes.
